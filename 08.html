    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">1)How do web search tools make it more efficient to find information?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;Web search tools make it more efficient to find information by stroing information and build a index for it.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">2)When you type a word or phrase into the Google search engine, what is the search algorithm that is being used?  Explain in your own words the process used by Google's search engine.</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;The google first search for their index that contain the words,then they look at what you have search before to find out what you are looking for,then they show up the website that is being to search the most. </p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">3)What is a captcha? How has the collective efforts of Internet users contributed to analyzing images through captchas?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp; Captcha is Completely Automated Public Turing test,that use to determine is you are human or bot.They volunteer to test it by giving access to free pornography .</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">4)"The architecture of human knowledge has changed as a result of search." Do you agree? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;I agree,because it help people a lot faster then before to gathering information or news,like you can find out the history very easily in the internet,even it's being ban by the government,you can still search it out.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">5)What are the differences between Figures 4.10 and Figure 4.11 in the book? Why are there differences even though they are both a Google search results page?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;The response of the falun gong is different,that if you search in initial google website,it will show you how to join it,if you search in chinese version,it will show the negative news of the falun gong.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">6)How do you think mobile computing might have influenced web searches? Would you retain your search history or delete it? Why?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;I think mobile computing shouldn't influenced web searches and I would delete my search history.Because I rarely search for a same things a lot of time,and if the websites base on what I have search before to decide what would I need,and show all the results is what I had been search before.Then it will be hard for me to search out a new things.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">7)Would you retain your search history or delete it? Why?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;I would delete it because I don't search for a same things again and again,I don't need the search engine to show it again and again.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">8)Should a researcher place absolute trust in a search engine? Why or why not?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;No,because the China search engine baidu is gain monet by putting fake medicine ad in their webpage.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">9)The authors claim "search is a new form of control over information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be important to talk about the social implications of searching on the Internet?</p>

<p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;It's important because searching is just like a teacher,that you can find out anythings happen in the world,and also other people can making fake media to control other people minds like making a fake news of how some race is dangerous.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">10)How have search trends been used to predict information? What are the positive and negative impacts of using trends to make predictions?</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;">&nbsp;Search trends is use to determine what kind of ad the user might like.The positve impacts is that you can get your personal advise on what you want.Negative impacts is that they can track your information.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">11)Find and read an article about web searches or algorithms. Write a 3-4 paragraph summary of the article. Include the author's name, the title of the article, the date it was published, and a link to the article.</p>
